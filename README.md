# E-Mart. The Shopping App

The e-commerce app built with React JS and Redux Toolkit is a user-friendly and fully functional web application that allows users to browse, shop, and purchase products online. With a sleek and modern user interface, the app provides an intuitive shopping experience for users.

One of the app's key features is the ability to edit and add new products to the catalog, making it easy for store administrators to keep their inventory up-to-date. Users can also sort products by price, allowing them to quickly find items that fit their budget, and filter products by category, making it easy to find products within specific categories.
